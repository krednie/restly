**WORK BETTER, FEEL BETTER**


**Restly gently helps you solve all your eyecare needs while using your favourite device(will soon expand to other platforms)**

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

You'll need GTK+3 development libraries installed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S gtk3
```

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krednie/restly.git
cd restly
```

2. Run the installer:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Compile the application
- Install it to `~/.local/bin/`
- Add the directory to your PATH
- Set up autostart configuration
- Optionally start the daemon immediately

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start with default settings (20-minute intervals, eye care routine)
restly

# Custom interval (30 minutes)
restly --interval 30

# Custom message instead of eye care routine
restly --message "Time for a coffee break!" --eyecare 0

# Active during work hours only
restly --active-hours 09:00-17:00
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--interval` | `-i` | Break interval in minutes | `20` |
| `--duration` | `-d` | Popup duration in seconds | `20` |
| `--message` | `-m` | Custom reminder message | `"Time to rest your eyes! (if eyecare disabled)"` |
| `--eyecare` | `-e` | Enable eye care routine (1) or custom message (0) | `1` |
| `--active-hours` | | Active time range (e.g., `09:00-17:00`) | `00:00-23:59` |
| `--stop` | | Stop the running daemon | |

### Eye Care Routine

When `--eyecare 1` is enabled, Restly guides you through a quick and easy yet cruicial routine.

This routine is based on the **20-20-20 rule**: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

### Managing the Daemon

```bash
# Start the daemon
restly --interval 25 --eyecare 1

# Stop the daemon
restly --stop

# Check if running
pgrep restly
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GTK+3 development libraries not found"**
- Install the development packages for your distribution (see Prerequisites)

**"Daemon not starting"**
- Check if another instance is running: `pgrep restly`
- Stop existing daemon: `restly --stop`

**"Popups not appearing"**
- Ensure your desktop environment supports notifications
- Check if notification permissions are enabled

**"PATH not found after installation"**
- Restart your terminal or run: `source ~/.bashrc`
- Manually add to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

### Uninstallation

```bash
# Stop the daemon
restly --stop

# Remove files
rm ~/.local/bin/restly
rm ~/.config/autostart/restly.desktop
rm /tmp/restlychild.pid

# Remove PATH entry from ~/.bashrc (manual)
```

## 💡 Tips for Healthy Computer Usage

- **Follow the 20-20-20 rule**: Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds
- **Blink frequently**: Computer work reduces blink rate by up to 60%
- **Adjust screen brightness**: Match your display to surrounding lighting
- **Position your screen**: 20-24 inches away, top at or below eye level
- **Take regular breaks**: Stand, stretch, and move around
- **Stay hydrated**: Keep water nearby and drink regularly
